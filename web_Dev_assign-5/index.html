<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.1** Whatâ€™s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous? -->
<!-- answer - The differences between asynchronous and synchronous include: Async is multi-thread, which means operations or programs can run in parallel. Sync is single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time. Async is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server -->



<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.2** What are Web Apis ? -->
<!-- answer - Web API as the name suggests, is an API over the web which can be accessed using HTTP protocol. It is a concept and not a technology. We can build Web API using different technologies such as Java, .NET etc. For example, Twitter's REST APIs provide programmatic access to read and write data using which we can integrate twitter's capabilities into our own application. -->


<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.3** Explain SetTimeOut and setInterval ? -->
<!-- answer -  The setTimeout() method is used to call a function after a certain period of time. The setInterval() Javascript method is used to call a function repeatedly at a specified interval of time. setTimeout() is cancelled by clearTimeout() method, and setInterval() is cancelled by clearInterval() method.-->



<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.4** how can you handle Async code in JavaScript ? -->
<!-- answer - In JavaScript, there are two common ways to work with asynchronous operations: then/catch method chaining and async/await . Both methods can be used to handle promises, which are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. -->




<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.5** What are Callbacks &  Callback Hell ? -->
<!-- answer - 
    Callbacks : A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution. A more formal definition would be - Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function
     Callback Hell :  Callback Hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. Every callback depends/waits for the previous callback, thereby making a pyramid structure that affects the readability and maintainability of the code-->


<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.6** What are Promises & Explain Some Three Methods of Promise -->
<!-- answer - Promises are useful when we have to handle more than one asynchronous task, one after another. For that, we use promise chaining. You can perform an operation after a promise is resolved using methods then() , catch() and finally() . -->


<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.7** Whatâ€™s async & await Keyword in JavaScript -->
<!-- answer -  await can be used on its own with JavaScript modules. Note: The purpose of async / await is to simplify the syntax necessary to consume promise-based APIs. The behavior of async / await is similar to combining generators and promises. Async functions always return a promise-->


<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.8** Explain Purpose of Try and Catch Block & Why do we need it? -->
<!-- answer - A try block is the block of code (contains a set of statements) in which exceptions can occur; it's used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. The try block is always followed by a catch block, which handles the exception that occurs in the associated try block. A try block must be used within the method and it must be followed by a catch block(s) or finally block or both.

Syntax of Try block
= try{    
= //code that may throw an exception    
= }catch(Exception) {
= //code
= }     -->


<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.9** Explain fetch -->
<!-- answer - The fetch() method in JavaScript is used to request data from a server. The request can be of any type of API that returns the data in JSON or XML. The fetch() method requires one parameter, the URL to request, and returns a promise. -->



<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.10** How do you define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using async/await? -->
<!-- answer -The async function declaration creates a binding of a new async function to a given name. The await keyword is permitted within the function body, enabling asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style and avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains  -->
